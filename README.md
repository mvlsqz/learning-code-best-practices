# Code Best Practices Learning Journey 🎯

Welcome to my personal learning repository where I'm developing advanced software engineering skills through hands-on projects and deep conceptual understanding.

## 👤 About Me

I'm **Marvin Velásquez** ([@mvlsqz](https://github.com/mvlsqz)), on a journey to become a proficient senior software engineer. I have experience with Python for tooling and scripting, Automation through IAC, CI/CD, Configuration Management tools, Kubernetes, Google Cloud, and AWS, and I'm expanding into TypeScript while mastering design patterns, data structures, and software architecture.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- **Master SOLID principles** and apply them instinctively
- **Understand design patterns** deeply (not just memorize)
- **Design scalable architectures** for real-world systems
- **Write production-grade code** in Python and TypeScript
- **Think like a senior engineer** - beyond just code

## ⏱️ Time Investment

**1 hour per day** | **20 weeks total** | **Project-based learning**

## 📚 What's Inside

This repository contains:
- **8 hands-on projects** from beginner to advanced
- **Comprehensive documentation** on SOLID principles, design patterns, and architecture
- **Dual implementations** - Python and TypeScript for each project
- **Progress tracking** via GitHub Issues
- **Code reviews** and learnings documented

## 🎓 Projects

### Project 1: Task Manager CLI ⏳
**Focus**: SOLID Principles  
Command-line task manager demonstrating all 5 SOLID principles with clean architecture.

[View Project](./projects/01-task-manager-cli/) | [Requirements Issue](#)

### Project 2: Text Search Engine
**Focus**: Data Structures  
*Coming soon...*

### Project 3-8
*See [LEARNING_ROADMAP.md](./LEARNING_ROADMAP.md) for full project list*

## 📝 Documentation Highlights

Key documents in this repo:
- [SOLID Principles Guide](./docs/solid-principles/) - In-depth explanations with examples
- [Design Patterns](./docs/design-patterns/) - When and how to use each pattern
- [Architecture Patterns](./docs/architecture/) - System design approaches
- [Best Practices](./docs/best-practices/) - Testing, code review, refactoring

## 💡 Key Learnings

I document major insights and "aha moments" here as I progress:

### Week 1
- Understanding that SOLID principles aren't rigid rules but guidelines with trade-offs
- Dependency Injection is key to testable code
- [More learnings coming...]

## 📚 Resources I'm Using

### Books
- "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin
- "Design Patterns" by Gang of Four
- "Clean Architecture" by Robert C. Martin

### Online
- [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru) - Design patterns

- Udemy courses on system design

## 🎯 Success Metrics

By the end of this journey, I will:
- ✅ Have built 8 production-grade projects
- ✅ Understand and apply 20+ design patterns
- ✅ Design systems with clean architecture
- ✅ Write comprehensive test suites
- ✅ Think at system level, not just code level
