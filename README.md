# Code Best Practices Learning Journey 🚀

A 20-week self-thought learning program to master software engineering best practices with TypeScript and Python.

## 👨‍💻 About This Journey

**Goal**: Progress from intermediate developer to senior-level engineer  
**Time Commitment**: 1 hour/day (7 hours/week)  
**Approach**: Project-based learning with conceptual foundations  
**Focus Areas**: Design patterns, data structures, architecture design

## 📚 Learning Philosophy

- **Bottom-up learning**: Build strong foundations before complex topics
- **Practical application**: Every concept learned through real projects
- **Both languages**: Implement in Python, then TypeScript for deeper understanding
- **Best practices**: Clean code, SOLID principles, testing, documentation

## 🗺️ The Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-4)
- SOLID Principles
- Advanced OOP concepts
- Data structures deep dive
- Type systems mastery

### Phase 2: Design Patterns (Weeks 5-10)
- Creational patterns
- Structural patterns
- Behavioral patterns
- When and how to apply them

### Phase 3: Architecture & System Design (Weeks 11-16)
- Clean Architecture
- API design
- Microservices basics
- Database design

### Phase 4: Senior-Level Practices (Weeks 17-20)
- TDD and testing strategies
- Performance optimization
- Production readiness
- Code review mastery
