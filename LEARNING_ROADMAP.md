# Code Best Practices Learning Journey 🚀

**Duration**: 20 weeks | **Daily Commitment**: 1 hour | **Approach**: Project-based learning

---

## 👨‍💻 About This Journey

This roadmap is designed to develop advanced programming knowledge through:
- **Hands-on projects** in Python and TypeScript
- **Deep understanding** of design patterns and architecture
- **Best practices** used in production-grade software
- **SOLID principles** and clean code
- **System design** and scalability

## 📚 Learning Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Why Before How** - Understand the reasoning behind every pattern
2. **Trade-offs** - Every architectural decision has costs and benefits
3. **Practical Application** - Learn by building, not just reading
4. **Incremental Complexity** - Each topic builds on previous knowledge
5. **Both Languages** - Implement in Python first, then TypeScript

### Daily 1-Hour Structure
- **20 minutes**: Concept study (reading, documentation)
- **35 minutes**: Hands-on coding
- **5 minutes**: Reflection and notes

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Consistency > Intensity**: 1 hour daily is better than 7 hours once a week
2. **Build to Learn**: Type the code yourself, don't copy-paste
3. **Understand Trade-offs**: Every pattern has pros and cons
4. **Compare Languages**: Implement in both Python and TypeScript
5. **Document as You Learn**: Write notes in your own words
6. **Ask Questions**: Use GitHub issues to track questions and insights
7. **Review Regularly**: Revisit previous projects to see improvements

---
**Remember**: Senior engineers aren't just code writers—they're problem solvers who make deliberate, informed decisions about architecture, patterns, and trade-offs.
